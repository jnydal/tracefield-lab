# Tracefield Lab — improvements backlog

Tracked gaps and follow-ups from pipeline/UI work (datasets, ingest, object storage, scalar features). For the Heat/Crime demo flow, see [DEMO_WALKTHROUGH_HEATCRIME.md](DEMO_WALKTHROUGH_HEATCRIME.md).

## Delivered (reference)

- **Scalar features from uploaded CSVs**: GUI **Extract scalar features** writes numeric/text columns into the feature store keyed by resolved entities (`POST /datasets/{id}/extract-scalar`). Analysis jobs can use those values without SQL seeds.
- **Resilience when object-store GET fails**: On ingest, the API stores **`ingest_columns_json`** (header names) and, for uploads **≤ 1 MB**, **`inline_file_b64`** so preview and scalar extract can fall back if MinIO/S3 read fails. See migration `017_dataset_file_ingest_cache.sql` and [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) (API ingest / preview).
- **UI**: Column pickers prefer **attached CSV header** (browser) → registered schema → **`latestFileColumns`** → **`POST …/sync-file-metadata`** → preview API. **`POST …/extract-scalar-upload`** sends the CSV with the job so extraction does not depend on MinIO/S3 GET.

## Open issues & improvements

### 1. No automated tests for ingest cache / scalar extract

**Gap:** The path “upload → DB columns + optional inline body → scalar extract without S3” is not covered by CI tests.

**Suggestion:** Integration test: ingest small CSV, stub or break S3 GET, assert scalar extract still completes and features exist; separate test with S3-only success.

---

### 2. Duplicate storage for small files (S3 + Postgres)

**Issue:** Files ≤ 1 MB are stored in object storage **and** as base64 in `dataset_files.inline_file_b64`. Doubles storage footprint for that tier and creates two sources of truth (mitigated by “S3 first, then inline”).

**Suggestions:**

- Document **retention** for `inline_file_b64` alongside raw objects ([NFR.md](../NFR.md) categories).
- Longer-term: optional **inline only on failed S3 verify** or **lazy backfill** after first failed GET (more complex).

---

### 3. Base64 in `TEXT` vs binary column

**Issue:** Inline file body is stored as base64 text (~33% overhead vs raw bytes).

**Suggestion:** Migrate to `BYTEA` (or equivalent) if inline storage grows; keep migration backward compatible.

---

### 4. Schema / Exposed typing for `ingest_columns_json`

**Issue:** Column is JSONB in SQL; Exposed maps it as nullable text. Works but is not type-expressive.

**Suggestion:** Use Exposed JSON/JSONB mapping if the stack supports it consistently across drivers.

---

### 5. Extra queries on `PUT /datasets/{id}`

**Issue:** After update, the handler loads `latestFileColumns`, `fileCount`, and `mappingsCount` via additional queries.

**Suggestion:** Acceptable for now; consolidate into one query or drop redundant fields from PUT response if clients only need them from `GET /datasets/{id}`.

---

### 6. Large files still fully dependent on object storage

**Issue:** Files **> 1 MB** have no inline fallback. Scalar extract and preview fail if S3 GET fails.

**Suggestions:** Raise cap with explicit ops limit, or **chunked / streaming** read path; avoid unbounded Postgres blobs.

---

### 7. `parseFullCsv` requires ≥ 2 non-blank lines for row maps

**Issue:** Historically, CSV with **header only** produced no parsed rows (empty column list from row keys). Header-only preview is now improved server-side for preview-rows; scalar extract still needs data rows to write features.

**Suggestion:** Document “header-only uploads cannot produce scalar features”; optional validation at ingest.

---

### 8. Demo / ops friction

**Issues encountered:**

- **`psql -f path` inside DB container** fails (path is container FS, not repo). **Fix:** pipe SQL from host (`< file.sql` or PowerShell `Get-Content … | psql`).
- **Existing datasets** before migration **017**: must **re-upload** once (or recreate) to populate `ingest_columns_json` / `inline_file_b64`.

**Suggestion:** Add a one-shot admin task or migration note in RUNBOOK (already partially there); consider **“Repair ingest metadata”** job that re-reads from S3 when healthy.

---

### 9. Embeddings worker still S3-only

**Issue:** `worker-embeddings` reads `object_uri` from DB; it does not use `inline_file_b64`. If S3 is broken, embeddings extract can still fail while scalar extract succeeds for small files.

**Suggestion:** Align worker with same fallback chain or document the limitation.
